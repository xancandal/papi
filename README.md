# PAPI

Using [PAPI](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/index.html), counters hardware are to be used to measure events in a Matrix multiplication program, which it has been adjusted the size to cache misses occurring events to be measured and include failures at several levels of cache.

PAPI is an acronym for Performance Application Programming Interface. The Performance API (PAPI) project specifies a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing hardware performance counters available on most modern microprocessors.
